## CO adsorption under atmospheric conditions

* CO desorption from a surface can be considered as a first order kinetic process depending only on the coverage of CO on the surface and temperature. Amenable to simulating with transition state theory 
** Determine the relative coverage of CO on the surface 
** Estimate the adsorption energy profile with temperature and coverage

* DFT calculation can be used to determine the energy as a function of coverage for all adsorption sites. 
** Predicts that up to 0.5ML of CO may be adsorbed on Au. Allows for the conversion of relative coverage to absolute monolayer coverage. 

* Benchmarking of adsorption energies on Au(211) shows that RPBE function may be about 0.2eV away from experimental TPD estimates. 
** Can obtain the barrier for CO desorption. Since CO desorption has a late transition state, the barrier can be approximated as the electronic energy of the reaction plus the ZPE. 
** The obtained value can be compared with the zero-coverage limit adsorption energy obtained from DFT calculations. The difference is close to 0.2eV. 


## Pb under-potential deposition 

## Surface Pourbaix diagram for Pb on Au 

* Coverage of Pb is large on a step even at positive potentials and increases at more reducing potentials. There is low coverage of Pb on a terrace at potentials considered in the experiment. Thus, step sites are blocked by Pb, while terrace sites are free to adsorb CO. 
** Agrees well with published experimental Pb CV data. 


## Effect of field and water

* Two competing effects dictate the stability of the CO on the surface - the field created at the interface due to the double layer and the effect of competitive water adsorption. 

* The interfacial dipole is the response to the field created by an adsorbate. The energetic effect of the field strongly depends on the dipole moment of the adsorbate. The dipole moment of the adsorbate can be given by fitting a quadratic polynomial to calculations carried out at different field strengths. 
** The dipole moment of CO is not large and hence the response to the electric field at the interface is small. This is in line with previous findings of CO on other metal surfaces. 

* At potentials more positive that the potential of zero charge, the effect of competitive adsorption may be strong. 
** Water orients with O facing down (density plot), implying competition with CO for the active site 
** Hypothesize that this is less of an issue at negative potentials, where the water largely orients with H facing down. 
** At the potential of zero charge, adsorption of CO on Au(211) and Au(100) are destabilized. 
** This is another effect that must be considered when determining binding strength at potentials near the pzc.
