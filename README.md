Gold Papers
==========

This directory contains all the scripts needed to generate plots for two gold papers. 

1. How to extract the adsorption energies, adsorbate-adsorbate interaction parameters, and saturation coverages with temperature programmed desorption experiments *benchmark_paper*

### TPD analysis

Code to parse TPD

2. Interaction of CO with gold under gas phase and electrochemical environments *electrochemical_gas_phase_paper*


### Experimental plot
Data for the experiments and figure from Thomas

### Pourbaix
Creates the pourbaix diagram (Figure 2 of the manuscript)

### Water adsorption
